== PREREQUISITES ==

opencv 3.2.0 (compiled with TBB disabled)


== SETUP ==

From the repository directory execute:

to add the missing files needed by the parsec benchmark suite
$ ./bin/extract_parsec.sh PATH/TO/parsec-3.0.tar.gz

to clean the environment
$ source bin/clean.sh

to setup the environment
$ source bin/setup.sh


== COMPILE ==

to compile a benchmark execute:
$ ./bin/compile.sh -p BENCHMARK_NAME -i INPUT_TYPE -nc NUM_OF_CORES -it MAX_ITERATIONS [-ht, -conf CONF_STRING, -tunerTime TIME_IN_SECS]

Example 1: the next command line compiles bodytrack using STATS, Hyper-Threading, and allowing 1 hour (3600 seconds) to the autotuner. It uses native inputs (the largest ones) as training inputs, it allows STATS to use 28 cores, the maximum number of executions for a specific configuration is 10 (note: the number of executions for a configuration can be less if the interval of confidence is within 10% of the mean).
$ ./bin/compile.sh -p bodytrack -i native -nc 28 -it 10 -tunerTime 3600 -ht

Example 2: the next command line compiles bodytrack forcing a specific configuration (underscore separated).
$ ./bin/compile.sh -p bodytrack -i native -nc 28 -it 10 -conf 1_2_4000_4_10_2_10_5_5


== RUN ==

after a benchmark has been compiled, the best configuration can be executed using:
$ ./bin/run.sh -p BENCHMARK_NAME -i INPUT_TYPE


== EXTEND THE FRAMEWORK ==
1) Add your compilers under "src" 

2) Edit src/compile.sh to compile your compilers. This script is invoked by "bin/setup.sh".

3) Edit scripts/frontEnd, scripts/middleEnd, and scripts/backEnd to use your front-end, middle-end, and back-end compilers
For the front-end compiler, you need to add "src_top" sources in a benchmark and remove the related "src". Your front-end compiler is responsible to generate "src" from "src_top".
By default, "src" already exist (the original benchmarks) and therefore the front-end compiler isn't invoked.

4) Edit scripts/autotuner and scripts/autotunerDesginSpace/* if you want to change the autotuner

5) Edit scripts/setup.sh if you need to copy files to "inst"
